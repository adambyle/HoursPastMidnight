# HoursPastMidnight

*Hours Past Midnight* is a multiplayer game played in the web browser where people act as world leaders in a world struggling to recover from nuclear war. Players make decisions that affect their own future and affect other players' gameplay in a turn-based strategy experience.

This project was created as an exercise to learn web sockets with C#.

## Thanks

I'd like to thank Paul Batum for the skeleton code for a web socket server at https://github.com/paulbatum/WebSocket-Samples/blob/master/HttpListenerWebSocketEcho/Server/Server.cs.
